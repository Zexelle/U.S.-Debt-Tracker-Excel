Lowest Debt Increase months historically occur during the months of April, May, June and July.

Hypothesis - During high months, there are holidays in the U.S. such as Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Years that people historically spend money buying gifts for others. People take out debts during these months to buy gifts.
There are no major holidays during the low months so people are taking out less debts.
